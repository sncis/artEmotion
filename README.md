# set up
Clone this project

run cd Art-e-motion

run make

If you get the following error:

xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun

then run xcode-select --install and wait for it to finish then try to run make again.

run cd main

run code . (If you get "command not found: code" , open VsCode, run command + shift + p search for "code" and choose Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH, return to terminal and run the command again) Or simply open the main folder manually in VSCode :D

open the main.pde.

if its the first time, make sure you have the "Processing Language" extension installed in VSCode and the processing IDE (https://processing.org/download/), open the processing IDE, go to tools/install "Processing-java" then return to VSCode and run command + shift + p, search for "task" and choose Processing: Create Task File.

run command + shift + b and enjoy!
